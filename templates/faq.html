                            Traditional animation software requires you to manually rig characters and create frame-by-frame animations. Our AI automates this process - it detects character poses automatically and applies pre-made or AI-generated motion. What might take hours in other tools can be done in minutes here.

T-pose or arms-away-from-body poses work best for automatic detection.
